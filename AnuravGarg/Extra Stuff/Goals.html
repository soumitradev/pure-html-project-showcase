    <h2>Our Goals</h2>

    <p>Here’s a list of goals we are trying to achieve, to help protect and aid Gamer youth’s all across the world:</p>

    <h3>Protecting our Freedom of Speech</h3>

    <p>Every culture has their own customs, their own languages, which they wish to protect and preserve. When it comes
        to Gamers, however, the world seeks to actively shun us for partaking in the customs and traditions that define
        us. They try take away our God-given right to freedom of speech, by calling our language “offensive” and
        “racist” and “sexist”. But nay we say! Our beautiful words that have passed down through generations of Gaming
        will not be silenced by society’s standards! IF I WANT, I WILL REFER TO MY OPPONENTS IN GAMES AS N-</p>

    <p>…</p>

    <p>My lawyer has advised me not to continue that sentence.</p>

    <h3>Protecting our Traditions</h3>

    <p>Gamers everywhere suffer from unfair standards society has placed on us, such as the need to “smell good” and
        “be hygienic”. Those not part of our community simply don’t understand the difference 10 more minutes of
        grinding can make. So what if we shower only once a month? So what if we pee in bottles during matches? Who
        decided that the natural odour emitted by our God-given human bodies is unacceptable?!</p>

    <p>To try make the world understand our plight and win our rights, we here at GGGG have organized several
        rallies and protests in various countries. So far they have been unsuccessful because Gamers would rather
        continue to sit at their desks than go outside to protest, but it is our belief that if enough people join
        our cause, the tides may yet change.</p>

    <h3>Protecting our Funding</h3>
