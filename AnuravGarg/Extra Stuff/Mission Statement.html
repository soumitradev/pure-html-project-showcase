    <h2>Our Mission Statement</h2>

    <p>Throughout the ages, countless battles have been fought, gamerade spilled, hours of potential grinding wasted,
        just so all the peoples of the world can have equal rights and representation everywhere.</p>
    <p>And yet, despite all this, one community has been conspicuously missing from all the reforms; that’s right,
        we’re talking about us Gamers.</p>

    <p>It is clear that the lizard people running the government have realized the power us Gamers can hold if we’re
        allowed to. Thus, systematic oppression of our rights and freedom of expression abounds all over the disk known
        as Earth.</p>

    <p>But, this shall change! We <strong><em>will</em></strong> rise up, and claim what is rightfully ours! No more
        shall the world oppress us!!</p>

    <p>GAMERS RISE UP!!!</p>
