    <h1>MR.SNAKE has escaped with 2 tonnes of weed, a million dollars and the boss's daughter, Stephanie. 
        As the mafia boss's right hand man it is your job to locate MR.SNAKE who is a master of disguise.
        As soon as you find MR.SNAKE you need to click the link on the page to follow him to his next hiding spot.
        He has 4 hideouts,finding all 4 would cause MR.SNAKES existence to vanish forever.
        Clicking the link before finding MR.SNAKE is admitting defeat and would make you a pussy ass faggot.
        Using inspect element or reading the code is also an instant loss because only the Boss gets to look at the code.
        If you feel stuck somewhere just refer to the hints page ive totally made.General tip; Think outside the box. Good luck</h1>
