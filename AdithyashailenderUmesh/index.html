    <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>


         <p>
         "Hotel California" is the title track from the Eagles' album of the same name and was
         released as a single in February 1977.Writing credits for the song are shared by Don Felder (music),
         Don Henley, and Glenn Frey (lyrics). Joe Walsh came up with the dual-guitar descending arpeggio part that ends the song:
         he did not, however, get writing credits.</p>
         
         <p>
         The Eagles' original recording of the song features Henley singing the lead
         vocals, and concludes with an electric guitar solo performed by both Walsh and Felder, in which they both
         take turns of playing lead before harmonising and playing the aforementioned arpeggio towards the fade out at the end.</p>

         <p>
         Commercially, "Hotel California" was a grand success and it 
         reached the <em>number one position on the Billboard Hot 100</em> and reached 
         the top ten of several international 
         charts.</p>

         <p>
         The song is considered the  best known recording by the band, and in 1998 its long 
         guitar coda was voted the best guitar solo of all time by readers of Guitarist.
         The song was awarded the <em>Grammy Award for Record of the Year in 1978.</em></p>
         
         <p>
         The lyrics of the song have been interpreted 
         by fans and critics alike, the Eagles themselves describing the song as their "interpretation of the high life in Los Angeles"
         . In the 2013 documentary History of the Eagles, Henley said that the song was about "a journey from innocence to experience ...
         that's all".</p>

    <h2 id="story">The Story And Why I Love It</h2>
         <p>
         The narrator is travelling on a lonely dessert road enjoying the freedom 
         and smells of the desert when in the far distance he sees a shimmering light.
         Weary of his travels with dimming sight and a heavy head he approaches the 
         light which clears into a hotel.</p>

         <p>
         A woman at the doorway stood ready to show him the way and 
         the narrator thinks <em>"This could be Heaven or this could be Hell"</em> 
         and so he sets the course for the rest of this story in a song ; 
         The Hotel California both heaven and hell.  </p>

         <p>
         The way this song enthralls you and draws you along for the story gives me goosebumps. You can almost Imagine the dark desert roads and the wind blowing through your hair.
         You experience the feelings that the man experiences just as you were him , like you were in The Hotel California.</p>

         <p>
         His fascination with the hotel along with the creeping fear and discomfort caused by the Hotel cpomes to life.
         We can feel the grotesque beings and their feast of the beast and the deep primal terror it invokes within the man and his desperate attempts to flee the Hotel in vain.</p> 
         <p>
         The song ends with a despairing man coming to terms that
         <em> <strong>"You can check-out any time you like But you can never leave!"</strong></em></p>
