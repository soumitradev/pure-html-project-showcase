        Television: My attention seeker
    </h1>
    <p>
        Televisions have always almost never failed to put me into the thought of wondering how they work. In this article, we are going to focus on the most common types of Television (abbreivated as TV) and their working.

    <h3>Most Common Types of TVs</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>LED</li>
        <li>LCD</li>

        A LED display is a flat panel display that uses an array of light-emitting diodes as pixels for a video display. Their brightness allows them to be used outdoors where they are visible in the sun for store signs and billboards. In recent years, they have also become commonly used in destination signs on public transport vehicles, as well as variable-message signs on highways. LED displays are capable of providing general illumination in addition to visual display, as when used for stage lighting or other decorative (as opposed to informational) purposes. LED displays can offer higher contrast ratios than a projector and are thus an alternative to traditional projection screens, and they can be used for large, uninterrupted (without a visible grid arising from the bezels of individual displays) video walls. microLED displays are LED displays with smaller LEDs, which poses significant development challenges

    <h3>
        LCD

        LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) is a type of flat panel display which uses liquid crystals in its primary form of operation. LEDs have a large and varying set of use cases for consumers and businesses, as they can be commonly found in smartphones, televisions, computer monitors and instrument panels.
        LCDs were a big leap in terms of the technology they replaced, which include light-emitting diode (LED) and gas-plasma displays. LCDs allowed displays to be much thinner than cathode ray tube (CRT) technology. LCDs consume much less power than LED and gas-display displays because they work on the principle of blocking light rather than emitting it. Where an LED emits light, the liquid crystals in an LCD produces an image using a backlight.

    <h3>
        OLED
    </h3>

        An OLED display follows the same principle as a LED display, but operates in a slightly different manner. A LED panel requires a dedicated backlighting setup to produce light. However, an OLED panel can produce its own light. All this is possible due specially constructed OLED diodes. An OLED diode is made of six different layers with two of them retaining organic properties. When current is passed through these diodes, these organic layers produce light which passes through a colour refiner that produce picture on the screen. As these panels do not require a backlit setup, TV makers can eliminate the extra bulk and make OLED TVs significantly thinner than LED TVs. In fact, these panels are so compact that they are even used in premium phones. Now you have the same, brilliant performance in a TV.
